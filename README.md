# C++ Self Study Course

This repository was created to help me learn C++ and to help others who are interested in learning C++. I will be adding more content to this repository as I learn more about it. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

Additionally, I will be adding C++ projects to this repository as I learn more about the language.
